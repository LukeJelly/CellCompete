/*
 * The Prompt:
 * Given a binary array of size n where n > 3. A true (or 1) value in the array 
 * means active and false (or 0) means inactive. Given a number k, the task is 
 * to find count of active and inactive cells after k days. After every day, 
 * status of iâ€™th cell becomes active if left and right cells are not same and 
 * inactive if left and right cell are same (both 0 or both 1).
 * Since there are no cells before leftmost and after rightmost cells, the value
 * cells before leftmost and after rightmost cells is always considered as 0 (or inactive).
 * 
 * Source:
 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/active-inactive-cells-k-days/
 * 
 * 
 * Solution:
 * This uses a personal implementation of doubly linked list to represent the 
 * group of cells, then I just traverse through the list to solve the problem.
 * 
 * //TODO: Below.
 * I think it mite actually be easier to solve this with a Deque and a Queue but
 * I will try that at a latter time.
